Shortest Underground Route
===============================

README  English | [Chinese](https://github.com/Andrew-xj/Shortest_Underground_Route/blob/master/README-zh.md)

## Introduction：

This project is based on the classic dijitstra shortest path algorithm using C + + to find the shortest path of the subway network, which is used to complete the Data-Structure course experiment.

## Features：

In this project, data like subway station and station spacing are put into two txt files respectively (take this project as an example: "Beijing Underground (arc).txt" and "Exchanging Station (vertex).txt"). By changing the corresponding data in these files, different subway networks can be generated automatically. In the process of running the program, you only need to input "departure station" and "terminal station" to complete the route search.
